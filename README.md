My name is Prakash,

Working as Senior Data scientist at [Qure.AI](https://qure.ai/),

### About me 🕴️
I am mostly looking at some data and trying to make sense of it. I would like to call myself a `Data Scientist & an Engineer`. I expertise in **Machine learning** and **Deep learning**. I use `Python` for writing code and always trying to make myself 1% better at it. I extensively document my work and love to look at the code I have written on `GitHub` (only). 

I expertise in `Computer vision` and solved different problems using Retail, satellite, medical & document images. Also have keen interest in time series forecasting and recommendation systems. 

### 𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝙸'𝚖 𝚞𝚙 𝚝𝚘 🔨
Lately I am in love with Bayesian stats and poking my head around it. U can expect some of my understandings and work to get published in the form of blogs soon 🤞
